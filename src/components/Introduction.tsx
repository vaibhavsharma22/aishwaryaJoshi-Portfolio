      As a UX Designer with hands-on experience in internships and freelance
      projects, I thrive on understanding people’s needs and finding solutions
      to their challenges. Currently in the final year of my Master’s in Design,
      I specialize in user research, wireframing, and prototyping—skills that
      help me craft intuitive and meaningful digital experiences. I’m passionate
      about the UX industry and love collaborating with users to design products
      that not only solve problems but also elevate everyday interactions. With
      a knack for managing projects from concept to completion, I’m excited to
      continue creating thoughtful, user-centered designs.
